## Hey, welcome to my github! I want to share some C stuff that I think is useful for students and beginners who are learning this awesome programming language. C is one of the oldest and most powerful languages out there, but it can also be tricky and confusing sometimes. That's why I decided to write some posts that explain certain concepts and features of C in a simple and fun way. I hope you enjoy them and learn something new!

>**_NOTE:_**    I'm using Linux
